# Introduction

*Echoes of Liberty* is a collection of essays and poems that explore the multifaceted nature of freedom in an age of displacement and longing. Born out of the experiences of writers who have lived between worlds—between homelands and exiles, between languages and memories—these texts seek to give voice to the silent struggles of those who have been uprooted.

Freedom is not merely the absence of chains; it is the ability to narrate one’s own story, to reclaim a past that has been erased, and to imagine a future that is not dictated by borders. The works gathered here traverse the landscapes of memory, identity, and resistance, asking what it means to be free when one’s very sense of self is fragmented.

This project aims to translate these reflections into Lithuanian, not simply as a linguistic exercise, but as an act of cultural preservation and dialogue. By bringing these ideas into the Lithuanian language, we hope to resonate with a community that has itself known exile, occupation, and the persistent quest for sovereignty.
